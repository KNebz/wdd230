    <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

    <h4>Google.com</h4>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google.com</a>

    <p>Google.com is a frequently used website. It is a strong example of visual hierarchy as its look is part of its fame. Google.com offers access and links to everything google has to offer but instead of providing a long complicated list of links and pictures which are difficult to navigate and search through it knows what is important and visually idenfies its most important feature. It is a search enginer first and foremost and this is apparant as the main feature of the site is large and in the center search bar. Below that there are smaller links to possible popular sites but the search bar is apparant and prominent.</p>

    <h3>White Space</h3>

    <h4>Hyer</h4>

    <p>Hyer's website shows a modren sleek design which makes good use of the white space throughout the page. Though there are a lot of advertisements, sales pitches and links to get started the site doesn't seem full or convoluted. There are large margins to the icons and text leaving a lot of white space but the website doesnt look empty either. The items of the page are not laying on top of each other and the links are clear, not crowding their icons and borders but clearly located. The intent of each element is clear and the page is quick and easy to scan as a result of their design.</p>

    <h3>Repetition</h3>
    
    <h4>Delta Airlines</h4>

    <p>This site uses good use of the design principle repetition. Delta colors are the navy blue and red and they use these colors consistently throughout the site so I know who the site is for. They also consistenly use the red color to show links to click in order to navigate to other places on the webpage or for better user experiences. As a user, I don't have to conutally check what is a link and what isn't, search for the options to select or know where I am at on the page as the color palette is used consistently I can quickly look for the red.</p>
